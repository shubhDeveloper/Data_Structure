1) MULTITHREADING IN JAVA ?

	  Multithreading in java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously. 
	  Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum
	  utilization of CPU. Each part of such program is called a thread.
	
	  Thread is basically a lightweight sub-process, a smallest unit of processing. Multiprocessing and multithreading, 
	  both are used to achieve multitasking. But we use multithreading than multiprocessing because threads share a
	  common memory area. They don’t allocate separate memory area so saves memory, and context-switching between the 
	  threads takes less time than process.
	  
2) MULTITASKING :-
      Multitasking is a process of executing multiple tasks simultaneously. We use multitasking to utilize the CPU. 
      Multitasking can be achieved by two ways:
      1) Process-based Multitasking(Multiprocessing).
      2) Thread-based Multitasking(Multithreading).
     
3) ADVANTAGES OF MULTITHREADING :-
      * It doesn’t block the user because threads are independent and you can perform multiple operations at same time.
      * You can perform many operations together so it saves time.
      * Threads are independent so it doesn’t affect other threads if exception occur in a single thread
        
4) WHAT IS THREAD :-
      * A thread is a lightweight sub process, a smallest unit of processing.
      
5) TWO WAYS TO ACHIEVE MULTITHREADING :-
      * extending thread class.
      * implementing runnable interface.
